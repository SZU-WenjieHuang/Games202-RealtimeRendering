  ***Description:*** In the Online courses by UC Santa Barbara, I have achieved many real-time rendering algorithms in the framework of WebGL. For example here is a PCSS Soft shadow, It works by taking into account the size and shape of the light source, as well as the distance and angle between the light source and the object casting the shadow, to create soft and realistic shadow edges.
